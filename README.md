## FoamAR - Augmented Reality 3D Modeling App
FoamAR is an Augmented Reality (AR) app for rapidly prototyping 3D models in the physical space. Using FoamAR, users like furniture designers, interior architects, and product engineers can build 3D models with real-life dimensions through a combination of intuitive freehand manipulations and traditional 2D UI interactions. Unlike existing CAD software whose means of interaction remains at the screen level, FoamAR enables users to sculpt their ideas directly with their own hands while referencing their surrounding environments in an immersive manner.
